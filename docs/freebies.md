# Freebies
Here are things that you get for free if you wish to work in Python.

- [AKDSFramework](https://github.com/theroyakash/AKDSFramework), a Purely written in Python library containing implementations of various data structures. See documentations [here $\to$](https://docs.akdsframework.theroyakash.com/).
- Benchmarking decorator: Use an one line import to profile any python function, `from AKDSFramework.applications.decorators import benchmark`. More on this here in this [blog post $\to$](https://publications.theroyakash.com/benchmark-your-python-program).
- A Python based caching decorator, to use in Dynamic Programming problems. More on this here in this [blog post $\to$](https://publications.theroyakash.com/cache-your-code).
- A big O analyser, find it [here $\to$](https://publications.theroyakash.com/introducing-an-efficient-big-o-analyzer). It works with most of the python programs but is not a good fit for more complex functions.
- [TinyDS](https://github.com/theroyakash/tinyds), small and simple pythonic implementations for most of your coding problems that are asked in SDE I or II interviews at FAANGs that you will be able to implement on the spot if asked.

## C++
I actually now prefer to solve algorithm problems in C++ now, so AKDSFramework alternative is here for C++. [Click to get it on Github $\to$](https://github.com/theroyakash/tinydscpp).

TinyDSC++ is a simple data structure implementation library that you can remember to implement in an interview setting.

## Contributing
There is some open positions for contribution in **AKDSFramework** **tinyds**, and **tinydscpp** projects. If you are willing to work open source please reach out to me at [hey@theroyakash.com](mailto:hey@theroyakash.com).

!!! warning Important
    Note that I am currently a masters student in computer science, so I won't be able to provide financial reimbursement for any of the contributions done for the project. If that does not bother you, please reach out.
