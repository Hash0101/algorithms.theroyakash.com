# :material-bag-personal: Knapsack Pattern

These problems discussed below conforms to one knapsack pattern. Using solutions to the knapsack problem and a little modification you'll be able to solve almost all of the following problems. We'll discuss this as we explain the code and the apporach to these problems.

## Subset Sum
## Equal sum partition
## Count of subset sum
## Minimum subset sum difference
## Target Sum
## Count the number of subsets with given difference
