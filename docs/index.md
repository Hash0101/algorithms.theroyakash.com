# theroyakash algorithms

Materials for FAANG and top startup coding interview and running notes on that. Made by [@theroyakash](https://www.theroyakash.com)

!!! danger "Who am I?"
    I go by theroyakash on the internet. I am a computer scientist will be starting my masters in computer science from IIT (Indian Institute of Technology), with research in high-performance algorithms, data structures, distributed systems, and beyond. See my work searching google for [theroyakash](https://g.co/kgs/Yx9DpE) and on [Github](https://github.com/theroyakash).

## What is this?
This material categorizes coding interview problems into a set of **8 patterns**. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the underlying pattern so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

**Complete guide and roadmap for SDE I and SDE II**
