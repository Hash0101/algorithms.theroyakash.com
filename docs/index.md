# theroyakash algorithms

Materials for FAANG and top startup coding interview and running notes on that. Made by [@theroyakash](https://www.theroyakash.com)

This material categorizes coding interview problems into a set ofÂ **8 patterns**. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the underlying pattern so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

**Complete guide and roadmap for SDE I**

## Patterns

1. Sliding Window Pattern 
2. Arrays and Strings
3. Linked lists
4. Stacks and Queues
5. Trees and Graphs along with heaps
6. Bit Manipulation (With C/C++)
7. Sorting and Searching
8. Dynamic Programming with Top Down (Recursive) approach
