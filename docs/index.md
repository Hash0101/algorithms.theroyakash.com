# theroyakash algorithms

Materials for FAANG and top startup coding interview and running notes on that. Made by [@theroyakash](https://www.theroyakash.com)

!!! danger "Who am I?"
    I go by theroyakash on the internet. I am a computer scientist currently doing masters in computer science from IIT (Indian Institute of Technology), with research in high performance algorithms, data structures, distributed systems, and beyond. See my work searching google for [theroyakash](https://g.co/kgs/Yx9DpE) and on [Github](https://github.com/theroyakash).

## What is this?
This material categorizes coding interview problems into a set ofÂ **8 patterns**. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the underlying pattern so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

**Complete guide and roadmap for SDE I and**

## Also Coming Soon
Few more freebies coming soon
- Complete Notes for Advanced algorithms design and selected data structure analysis
- Randomized algorithm notes
- Distributed Systems Book [expected 2023 Summer].

## Patterns

1. Sliding Window Pattern 
2. Arrays and Strings
3. Linked lists
4. Stacks and Queues
5. Trees and Graphs along with heaps
6. Bit Manipulation (With C/C++)
7. Sorting and Searching
8. Dynamic Programming with Top Down (Recursive) approach
