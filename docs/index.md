## What is this?
This material categorizes coding interview problems into a set of **8 patterns**. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **analysis techniques** - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the _underlying pattern_ so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

**Complete guide and roadmap for SDE I and SDE II algorithm round.**

## Patterns

1. [Sliding Window Pattern](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/arrays/sliding-window/), more is being added.
2. Arrays and Strings
3. [Recursion](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/recursion/intro/) and [problems coming soon](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/recursion/problems/)
4. [Linked lists](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/LinkedLists/stl-usage/) and [problems](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/LinkedLists/problems/)
5. [Stacks](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/stacks/usage/) and Queues
6. [Binary Search](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/bss/) and [Problems (more coming soon)](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/otherbinarysearch-problems/)
7. [Trees](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/trees/implementation/) and [Graphs](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/graph/usage/) and [Graph Problems](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/graph/problems/), along with [heaps](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/heaps/heap-pq/) and [heap problems](https://algorithms.theroyakash.com/heaps/problems/)
8. Bit Manipulation (With C/C++)
9. Sorting and Searching [coming soon]
10. Dynamic Programming with Top-Down (Recursive) approach [coming soon]

I go by theroyakash on the internet. I am a computer scientist will be starting my masters in computer science from **IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)**, with research in **high-performance algorithms**, **data structures**, **distributed systems**, and beyond. See my work searching google for [theroyakash](https://g.co/kgs/Yx9DpE) and on [Github](https://github.com/theroyakash).
