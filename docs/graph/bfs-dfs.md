# Breath first and depth first search
BFS and DFS are two of the most common graph as well as tree traversal techniques that ever existed. You should always understand the basic understanding behind these traversals.

## Things to remember about
- BFS uses a queue and FIFO ordering is something that it uses.
- DFS uses recursion, recursivly goes in depth until the element is found.

## Standard Graph implementation
We'll use our own standard implementation for graph and will write BFS and DFS to work on that standard graph.

This following graph implementation may not be the very best implementation that you'll find, but it is good enough and most importantly you'll be able to implement this in an interview setting.
