## What is this?
This material categorizes coding interview problems into a set of **8 patterns**. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **analysis techniques** - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the underlying pattern so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

**Complete guide and roadmap for SDE I and SDE II**

I go by theroyakash on the internet. I am a computer scientist will be starting my masters in computer science from **IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)**, with research in **high-performance algorithms**, **data structures**, **distributed systems**, and beyond. See my work searching google for [theroyakash](https://g.co/kgs/Yx9DpE) and on [Github](https://github.com/theroyakash).
